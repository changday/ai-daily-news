# AI Daily News

Welcome to AI Daily News, your source for the latest news and information about artificial intelligence. As AI technology continues to advance rapidly, it's impacting more aspects of our lives and jobs. That's why we created this site - to keep you informed about the key AI developments you need to know about.

## How do I add content?

All the content is written in markdown (.md) and grouped as `blog` or `projects` in the `content` directory. All the default markdown syntax will work. You also have a few example custom markdown elements like _YouTube embed_, _Twitter embed_, etc. You can create your own custom components too in two easy steps.

1. Add a markdoc config. Check out the markdoc config in [src/lib/markdoc/config.ts](src/lib/markdoc/config.ts) to learn how to add custom components.
2. Add a component to render your custom component. Check out the Renderer in [src/components/Renderer.astro](src/components/Renderer.astro).

## How do I make it my blog?

Easy.

- All content is static and everything is straight forward. Change whatever you need to change.
- Delete or update the content in `content/{content-group}`. `content-group` could be `blog`, `projects` or `anything`.
- (Optional) If you need more content types like _Notes_, just create a new dir in `content` and add a new frontmatter validator like [src/lib/markdoc/blog/frontmatter](src/lib/markdoc/blog/frontmatter).

## How do I deploy?

`yarn build` will generate a static website in `dist` dir. You can host it with any static hosting. If you need a recommendation, check out [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
