# AI Daily News

Welcome to AI Daily News, your source for the latest news and information about artificial intelligence. As A.I. technology continues to advance rapidly, it's impacting more aspects of our lives and jobs. That's why I created this project - to keep you informed about the key AI developments you need to know about.
