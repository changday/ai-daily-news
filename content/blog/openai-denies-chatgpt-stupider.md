title: OpenAI Vice President denies they're making ChatGPT stupider
description: "“No, we haven't made GPT-4 dumber,” Welinder tweeted on Thursday. “Quite the opposite: we make each new version smarter than the previous one. Current hypothesis: When you use it more heavily, you start noticing issues you didn't see before.”"
